# OptionAI Frontend & Backend Integration Plan

## ðŸ“œ Overall Mission & Core Principles
- **Mission:** Understand the existing frontend and backend codebases, establish a successful connection between them, and enable the core application functionality for the hackathon demo.
- **Principles:**
    - Document findings clearly.
    - Establish a repeatable process for running the full-stack application.
    - Identify and resolve key integration blockers.
    - Work from a clear, shared understanding of the system architecture.

## PHASE 0: Codebase Audit & Familiarization

-   [ ] **Task 1: Initial File Structure Analysis**
    -   [x] Review the file list provided.
    -   [ ] Document initial hypotheses about the tech stack and architecture.
-   [ ] **Task 2: Frontend Deep Dive**
    -   [ ] Read `package.json` to identify all dependencies, scripts (dev, build, test), and project metadata.
    -   [ ] Read `vite.config.ts` to understand the build and dev server setup.
    -   [ ] Analyze `src/main.tsx` and `src/App.tsx` to understand the root of the application and routing.
    -   [ ] Examine key components (`DiscussionSetup.tsx`, `MeetingRoom.tsx`, `ConclusionPage.tsx`) to map out the user flow and identify where backend communication likely occurs.
-   [ ] **Task 3: Backend Deep Dive**
    -   [ ] Read `OptionAI-python/README.md` for any setup instructions or project descriptions.
    -   [ ] Determine the backend server technology. Is it Python (Flask/FastAPI?) or Node.js (`server.js`)?
    -   [ ] If Node.js, analyze `OptionAI-python/server.js` to see how it works. Does it wrap or execute the Python scripts?
    -   [ ] If Python, analyze `OptionAI-python/controller.py` to understand the core logic and API endpoints.
    -   [ ] Identify Python dependencies (look for `requirements.txt` or similar).
-   [ ] **Task 4: Synthesize Findings & Architect a Plan**
    -   [ ] Create a Mermaid diagram to visualize the application architecture.
    -   [ ] Document how to run the frontend and backend servers independently.
    -   [ ] Identify the specific API endpoints the frontend needs to call.
    -   [ ] Formulate a plan for connecting the frontend to the backend.

## PHASE 1: Connection & Integration

-   [ ] **Task 1: Run Both Services**
    -   [ ] Start the frontend development server.
    -   [ ] Start the backend server.
    -   [ ] Troubleshoot any startup errors.
-   [ ] **Task 2: Implement Frontend-to-Backend Communication**
    -   [ ] If not already present, add a proxy to the Vite config to avoid CORS issues during development.
    -   [ ] Modify frontend components to call the correct backend API endpoints.
    -   [ ] Ensure data is being sent and received correctly between the two services.
-   [ ] **Task 3: Full Feature Test**
    -   [ ] Perform a full end-to-end test of the application's main feature.
    -   [ ] Document any bugs or issues found.

---

## PHASE 2: Testing & Refinement

-   [ ] **Task 1: Run Test Suites**
    -   [ ] Execute any existing frontend test suite (`npm test`).
    -   [ ] Execute any existing backend test suite.
-   [ ] **Task 2: Bug Fixing**
    -   [ ] Address any issues discovered during integration and testing.
-   [ ] **Task 3: Final Polish**
    -   [ ] Clean up code and add comments where necessary.
    -   [ ] Prepare for handoff to teammates.
