# Product Design Requirements: "Devil's Advocate" & "Alternative View" Generation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the product design requirements for the "Devil's Advocate" & "Alternative View" Generation feature for Option.ai. This feature is designed to enhance the decision-making process by introducing intelligent, AI-generated counter-arguments and alternative perspectives, thereby combating groupthink and strengthening the final conclusion.

## 2. Goals

*   **Primary Goal:** To improve the quality and robustness of decisions by actively challenging the consensus and exploring alternative solutions.
*   **Secondary Goals:**
    *   To increase user engagement by providing a more dynamic and interactive experience.
    *   To differentiate Option.ai from other discussion and decision-making platforms.
    *   To provide users with a more comprehensive understanding of the topic by highlighting potential risks, alternative viewpoints, and unforeseen consequences.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Teams and organizations that use Option.ai for critical decision-making.
*   **Secondary:** Individuals who use Option.ai for personal decision-making and want to explore all possible angles of a topic.

## 4. Feature Description

The "Devil's Advocate" & "Alternative View" Generation feature will be accessible from the `ConclusionPage`. It will consist of two main components:

1.  **"Devil's Advocate" Mode:** When activated, this mode will generate a well-reasoned counter-argument to the current consensus. The AI will analyze the discussion, identify the main arguments supporting the conclusion, and then generate a compelling case against it.
2.  **"Alternative View" Generation:** This feature will generate a list of alternative solutions or perspectives that were not fully explored in the discussion. The AI will analyze the topic and the discussion to identify potential blind spots and suggest new avenues for consideration.

## 5. Functional Requirements

*   **User Interface:**
    *   A new section will be added to the `ConclusionPage` to house the "Devil's Advocate" & "Alternative View" Generation feature.
    *   This section will include two distinct buttons: "Challenge Consensus" (for the "Devil's Advocate" mode) and "Explore Alternatives" (for the "Alternative View" Generation).
    *   When a button is clicked, a new card or modal will appear, displaying the AI-generated content.
    *   The UI will be designed to be clean, intuitive, and consistent with the "Clarity in the Deep" design system.
*   **Backend:**
    *   A new API endpoint will be created to handle requests for the "Devil's Advocate" and "Alternative View" generation.
    *   This endpoint will accept the current discussion context (topic, transcript, and current conclusion) as input.
    *   The backend will use a powerful language model (e.g., GPT-4.5) to generate the counter-arguments and alternative views.
    *   The prompt for the language model will be carefully engineered to produce high-quality, relevant, and well-reasoned content.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The user navigates to the `ConclusionPage` after a discussion.
    2.  The user clicks either the "Challenge Consensus" or "Explore Alternatives" button.
    3.  The frontend sends a request to the new API endpoint with the current discussion context.
    4.  The backend generates the requested content and returns it to the frontend.
    5.  The frontend displays the content in a new card or modal.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The AI-generated content should be returned to the user in a timely manner (ideally within 5-10 seconds).
*   **Scalability:** The backend should be able to handle a high volume of requests for this feature.
*   **Security:** All communication between the frontend and backend will be encrypted.
*   **Usability:** The feature should be easy to discover and use, with clear and concise labels and instructions.

## 7. Design & UX Mockups

*   **Low-Fidelity Wireframes:**
    *   A new section will be added below the main conclusion on the `ConclusionPage`.
    *   This section will contain two side-by-side buttons: "Challenge Consensus" and "Explore Alternatives."
    *   Clicking a button will reveal a new card with the generated content.
*   **High-Fidelity Mockups:**
    *   The new section will be designed to be visually distinct but consistent with the overall theme.
    *   The buttons will use the primary and secondary accent colors to draw attention.
    *   The generated content will be displayed in a clean, readable format, with clear headings and a professional tone.

## 8. Future Enhancements

*   **Interactive Counter-Arguments:** Allow users to "debate" with the "Devil's Advocate" AI, asking follow-up questions and exploring the counter-arguments in more detail.
*   **Customizable AI Personas:** Allow users to choose from a variety of AI personas for the "Devil's Advocate" mode (e.g., "Skeptical Analyst," "Creative Thinker," "Risk-Averse Manager").
*   **Integration with Project Management Tools:** Allow users to export the generated alternative views as tasks or action items in their project management software.
